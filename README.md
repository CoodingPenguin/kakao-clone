## 1. Screen Size Warning

#### Screen Width

If your screen width is over 550px, the following page appears.

<img src="img/size-warning-1.PNG" width=600px>

#### Screen Height

If your screen height is under 200px, the following page appears.

<img src="img/size-warning-2.PNG" width=600px>

## 2. Header Wrapper

Add `header wrapper` to all pages. So although you scroll the page, the header is fixed.

## 3. Friends Page

I added more friend elements of `friends-list` and changed each profile photo. And I also synchronized `Friends 7` and the number of friends.

## 4. Chats Page

#### Make a Group Chat

I made a group chat with more than four people except me. And I also marked how many people are in there next to the name of the chat.

#### Sort Chats and Modify Timestamps

I sorted chats by time. So the higher a message is placed, the later it arrives. Of course I synchronized the date.

#### Make Unread Chats

I made some unread messages and added unread badges below the timestamp and also synchronized the number of remained messages.

## 5. Kakao Pay

Today's Kakao Talk has Kakao Pay. So I added `Kakao Pay Tab` to the page.

## 6. Settings Page

I added more setting tabs to the page.
